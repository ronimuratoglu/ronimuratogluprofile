			<h2>About me!</h2>
			<p>Let me tell you a bit about myself! I'm originally from Armenia but I lived all my life in Turkey. I can speak 4 languages. Armenian and Turkish are my best ones. I can speak english and french too. In addition, I am trying to learn spanish. In turkey, I was living with my parents and my sister. Because of my school I moved to France and I am living alone. I also have lots of different interests which you will discover as you scroll down my page!

			<h2>My interests!</h2>
			<p>I don't have so so many different interests. But I want to tell them to you. First of all, I love basketball and I have been playing it for twelve or thirteen years. Additionally, I like playing football too. When I was little I learned and played so many different sports, that is why I can play all of them right now. That is why I never get bored and I always do sports. I love meeting my friends and I really pass all my life outside of my house. And lastly, I use social media a lot. </p>

			<h2>Travels</h2>
			<p>I hadn't travelled a lot but I had seen many good countries. I had seen Italia, France, Netherlands, Australia etc. The thing that I like the most when I visit a country is to find the best football team of that country and go to their football match. Additionally my most different trip was Australia because all the countries I have visited weren't very different from each other but Australia was really different from all the other countries I had seen. </p>
